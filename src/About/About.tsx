    <h2>Paucis Verbis Cards</h2>
    <p>
      The Paucis Verbis (PV) cards were initially developed as a bedside teaching tool used by
      Academic Life in Emergency Medicine (ALiEM) Founder and Editor-in-chief Michelle Lin. They
      were short, succinct, rapid-fire summaries of key learning points on various Emergency
      Medicine (EM) topics that would fit on a 5 x 7 index card. Michelle carried these cards in her
      pocket and handed them out to trainees as needed. Eventually others at her institution began
      using the cards and as digital and mobile technology became more ubiquitous, Michelle
      transitioned the cards to several mobile platforms so that she could share them with the
      greater EM community.
